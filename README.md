# Detailed Discription
A text file will be provided with a bunch of words that are postive or have a very postive meaning. 
The code <em>Made in Python</em> Will look at the word or words that the user entered and will then make it possibale to print out the letter of the word <em>H in Hello from the example above</em>.
Then fallowed with a possitve letter
The cod will see if the positve word has been used first. 
If so check if the there are more postive words that could be used. 
If there are no more postive words for that letter, go back to the orginal postive word.

<em>So if <strong>Love</strong> was only used once and there was not another <strong>L</strong> postive word then the next <strong>L</strong> will be <strong>Love</strong> again
